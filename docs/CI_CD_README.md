# CI/CD Setup Complete

Your MAGAX smart contract project now has a complete CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions.

## What's Been Added

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/smart-contracts.yml`)

- **Automated Testing**: Runs on every push and PR
- **Testnet Deployment**: Auto-deploys to Sepolia on `develop` branch
- **Mainnet Deployment**: Deploys to mainnet on `main` branch with `[DEPLOY-MAINNET]` tag
- **Contract Verification**: Automatically verifies contracts on Etherscan
- **Security Scanning**: Basic security checks and analysis

### 2. Enhanced Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy.js`)

- Saves deployment information to `deployments/` folder
- Creates both network-specific and timestamped deployment files
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Transaction hash and block number tracking

### 3. Gas Price Checker (`scripts/check-gas-price.js`)

- Check current gas prices before mainnet deployment
- Estimates deployment costs
- Provides deployment recommendations

### 4. Updated Configuration

- **hardhat.config.js**: Added mainnet network and Etherscan verification
- **env.example**: Added all required environment variables

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Secrets

Follow the guide in `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md` to configure:

- `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` - For testnet deployments
- `MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY` - For mainnet deployments  
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` / `MAINNET_RPC_URL` - RPC endpoints
- `TREASURY_ADDRESS` / `RECORDER_ADDRESS` - Wallet addresses
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` - For contract verification

### 2. Test the Pipeline

#### Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Push to develop branch to trigger testnet deployment
git checkout develop
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin develop
```

#### Mainnet Deployment (when ready)

```bash
# Push to main with special tag to trigger mainnet deployment
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to mainnet [DEPLOY-MAINNET]"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor Deployments

- Check GitHub Actions tab for deployment status
- Review deployment artifacts in the Actions run
- Contract addresses will be saved to `deployments/` folder

## How It Works

### Deployment Flow

1. **Code Push** → **Tests Run** → **Deploy** → **Verify** → **Save Info**
2. **Testnet**: Automatic on `develop` branch
3. **Mainnet**: Manual trigger with `[DEPLOY-MAINNET]` in commit message

### Contract Address Management

- Addresses are saved to `deployments/{network}.json`
- Historical deployments saved with timestamps
- CI/CD automatically updates backend configuration

### Security Features

- Environment-specific deployment keys
- Manual approval for mainnet deployments (configurable)
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Gas price monitoring

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check gas prices before deployment
npx hardhat run scripts/check-gas-price.js --network mainnet

# Test local deployment
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

# Manual verification
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia CONTRACT_ADDRESS "CONSTRUCTOR_ARG"

# Run tests locally
npx hardhat test
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file for local testing:

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Fill in your values (don't commit this file!)
```

## GitHub Environments (Optional)

For additional security, set up GitHub environments:

1. Repository Settings → Environments
2. Create `testnet` and `production` environments
3. Add protection rules for production (require approval)

## Monitoring & Alerts

The pipeline includes:

- Slack notifications for deployments (configurable)
- GitHub release creation for mainnet deployments
- Deployment artifacts and gas usage reports
- Contract verification status

## Troubleshooting

- **Insufficient funds**: Check wallet ETH balance
- **Gas too high**: Use gas price checker script
- **Verification fails**: Check Etherscan API key and wait for block confirmation
- **Tests fail**: Fix tests before deployment will proceed

Your smart contracts are now ready for professional deployment!
