# MoonShot MAGAX

## Token Details

- **Token Name:** MoonShot MAGAX

Complete ecosystem for the MoonShot MAGAX token, including the ERC-20 token contract and presale receipt tracking system. Built using Solidity and deployed via Hardhat.

---

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main smart contracts:

### 1. **MoonShotMAGAX Token**

- ERC-20 token with fixed supply
- Standard token functionality

### 2. **MAGAXPresaleReceipts**

- On-chain presale tracking system
- Records purchase receipts for transparency
- Role-based access control

---

## � Token Details

- **Token Name:** MoonShot MagaX
- **Symbol:** MAGAX
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000 MAGAX (1 Trillion)

---

## Presale System

The presale receipt system provides:

- **Transparent tracking** of all presale purchases
- **On-chain receipts** showing USDT paid and MAGAX allocated
- **Role-based security** with PRESALE_MANAGER_ROLE for authorized purchase recording
- **Pausable functionality** for emergency control
- **Multi-purchase support** per buyer
- **50-stage presale system** with configurable pricing
- **Referral program** with 7% referrer and 5% referee bonuses

### Key Features

- Records USDT amount (6 decimals) and MAGAX amount (18 decimals)
- Timestamp tracking for each purchase
- Total supply tracking (totalUSDT & totalMAGAX)
- Access control with admin and recorder roles
- Emergency pause/unpause functionality

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the environment template and fill in your values:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
TREASURY_ADDRESS=0xYourTreasuryWalletAddress
RECORDER_ADDRESS=0xYourRecorderWalletAddress
```

### 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (73 tests including referral system)
npx hardhat test

# Run only referral system tests
npx hardhat test --grep "Referral System"
```

### 5. Deploy to Sepolia

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Contract deployment and initialization
- Purchase recording functionality
- Access control and security
- Pause/unpause mechanisms
- Edge cases and error handling

Run all tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Access Control Roles

- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Can pause/unpause contract, grant/revoke roles
- **RECORDER_ROLE**: Can record presale purchases (typically backend or multisig)

### Security Measures

- Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin
- Pausable functionality for emergency stops
- Input validation and proper event emission
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Usage Example

### Recording a Presale Purchase

```solidity
// Only addresses with RECORDER_ROLE can call this
presaleReceipts.recordPurchase(
    buyerAddress,           // Buyer's wallet address
    100000000,              // 100 USDT (6 decimals)
    1000000000000000000000  // 1000 MAGAX (18 decimals)
);
```

### Viewing Purchase History

```solidity
// Anyone can view receipts
Receipt[] memory receipts = presaleReceipts.getReceipts(buyerAddress);
```

## Gas Usage

| Function | Gas Usage |
|----------|-----------|
| Deploy Contract | ~1.05M gas |
| Record Purchase | ~83k-163k gas |
| Pause/Unpause | ~25k-47k gas |

### ⚠️ Gas Considerations for Dynamic Arrays

The `userReceipts` mapping stores dynamic arrays that can grow without bound as users make multiple purchases. Key considerations:

- **Pagination**: Use `getReceiptsPaginated()` for users with many purchases to avoid gas limit issues
- **Recommended Limits**: Consider implementing per-user purchase frequency limits in your frontend/backend
- **Gas Cost Growth**: Each additional receipt increases gas costs for array operations
- **Best Practice**: For high-frequency users, consider batching multiple small purchases into larger ones

**Frontend Integration**: Always use pagination when displaying user purchase history for accounts with >100 purchases.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** - it contains sensitive private keys
- **Test thoroughly on testnets** before mainnet deployment
- **Use a multisig wallet** for the RECORDER_ROLE in production
- **Keep your private keys secure** and never share them
