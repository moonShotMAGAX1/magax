# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES FOR REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENT
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS:
#    - All addresses must be valid 42-character Ethereum addresses (0x + 40 hex chars)
#    - Use different addresses for each role to minimize security risks
#    - Consider using hardware wallets or multi-sig wallets for critical roles
#
# 2. PRIVATE KEY SECURITY:
#    - NEVER commit private keys to version control
#    - Use environment variables or secure key management systems
#    - Consider using separate private keys for testnet vs mainnet
#
# 3. MULTI-SIG WORKFLOW:
#    - Critical operations require 2 confirmations from the same role
#    - Example: finalise() requires 2 FINALIZER role addresses to confirm
#    - Emergency operations require 2 EMERGENCY role addresses
#
# 4. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
#    - ✓ Replace all placeholder addresses with real Ethereum addresses
#    - ✓ Set up proper RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, or own node)
#    - ✓ Verify API keys for contract verification
#    - ✓ Test on testnet before mainnet deployment
#    - ✓ Ensure multi-sig wallets are properly configured
#
# 5. RECOMMENDED ROLE DISTRIBUTION:
#    - TREASURY: Company multi-sig wallet (receives MAGAX tokens)
#    - RECORDER: Backend service (automated purchase recording)
#    - ADMIN: Technical lead (contract administration)
#    - FINALIZER: Business lead (presale finalization)
#    - EMERGENCY: Security team (emergency operations)
#
# 6. NETWORK CONFIGURATION:
#    - Ethereum: For MAGAX token deployment and treasury operations
#    - Polygon: For presale contract deployment (lower gas costs)
#    - Ensure both networks use the same role addresses for consistency
